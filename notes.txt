INFINITY X 

create automated workflows 

Web hook -> two different backends talk to each other via web hooks
Asynchronous backend communication
transactional outbox pattern

e.g. razorpay : as banks dont provide api's to everyone so payment gateways (razorpay, stripe, paytm, phonepay) help in between. 
there are always razorpay and the bank backends talking to each other via web hooks
